# Hi there, nice to meet you :nerd_face:

My name is Jo√£o Mateus Alves Borges de Melo, but you can call me **John**

I'm a Node.js and React Junior developer that loves technology. I think it's a way that we programmers can change the world to a better place by solving problems using code.

I'm currently working on personal projects focusing in learning docker and docker compose.

Feel free to reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jo%C3%A3o-mateus-36056b191/?locale=en_US) so we can have a good conversation.

So, let's get going and **never stop learning!**
